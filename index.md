This podcast is an attempt to read underrated drama plays and short stories without lingual boundaries. However the podcast will primarily be in Tamil with sprinkles of English here and there. This show tries to bring in common audience for discussion & will happen in cycle every Sunday 9 PM. The discussion link will be published in my twitter account. Please do follow and join the discussion. Looking forward to know a lot more like minded people.
